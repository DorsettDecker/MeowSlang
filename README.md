# MeowSlang
This repo contains a documentation about the Meow slang that I use.

There are different occassions when I say meow. The meaning of each "meow" depends upon the context of the chat and the sentence in which "meow" is used. I have talked about each of it in the following heads.
<br>
<h3>Meow</h3>
<p>Basically acknowledging</p>
<h3>Meow!</h3>
<p>It usually means "Yes!"</p>
<br>
<h3>Meow?</h3>
<p>It means I am in doubt or didn't fully understand what you said.</p>
<br>
<h3>Meow?!</h3>
<p>It means I am shocked and I am asking for confirmation if what you said is true.</p>
<br>
<h3>Curses</h3>
<p>When I have to curse, instead of actually saying any abusive words, I replace them with "meow". For example: I don't give a meow. (I don't give a fk)</p>
